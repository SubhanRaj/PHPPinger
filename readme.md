<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Pinger Screenshot][product-screenshot]](https://pinger.masterofcosmos.com)

Pinger is a web application that allows you to quickly check the connectivity and response time of a website or IP address. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface to perform ping tests and obtain real-time results.

### Built With

* [![PHP][PHP]][PHP-url]
* [![Bootstrap][Bootstrap.com]][Bootstrap-url]
* [![JQuery][JQuery.com]][JQuery-url]

* Pinger is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery for the frontend, and PHP for the backend. AJAX is used for asynchronous communication between the client and server, ensuring a seamless user experience.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* XAMPP

### Installation

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SubhanRaj/Pinger.git
   ```
2. Start Apache  in XAMPP
   
3. Goto `localhost/Pinger` in your browser

4. Keep Pinging!

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

1. **Network Troubleshooting:** Use Pinger to quickly check the connectivity and response time of websites or IP addresses. It can help identify network issues, such as slow or unresponsive connections, and provide valuable insights for troubleshooting.

2. **Website Monitoring:** Monitor the availability and responsiveness of your own websites or critical online services. Set up regular pings to ensure they are up and running smoothly, and receive instant notifications if any issues arise.

3. **Server Monitoring:** Ping servers within your network to ensure their availability and responsiveness. This can be useful for system administrators or DevOps teams to monitor the health and performance of their servers.

4. **DNS Configuration Testing:** Verify the DNS configuration of a website by pinging its IP address. This can help diagnose DNS-related issues, such as incorrect or misconfigured DNS settings.

5. **Performance Testing:** Measure the response time of different websites or IP addresses to compare their performance. This can be helpful when choosing hosting providers or assessing the overall speed and reliability of different online services.

6. **Educational Purposes:** Learn about network connectivity and how ping works by using Pinger as an educational tool. Understand the concept of round-trip time (RTT) and observe how different factors can affect network latency.
